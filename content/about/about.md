I'm a passionate full-stack software engineer focused on **Ruby on Rails**, **React**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL**. Experienced in agile workflow, including CI/CD methodologies. I aim to create solid and expandable applications by primarily focusing on developing the backend and frontend. Delivering high-quality software solutions to drive business growth and enhance user experiences, and always try to learn something new from that process.

Some of my software stacks I’m always putting into practice:

- Ruby on Rails
- SQL
- React
- Javascript (vanilla) and jQuery
- HTML/CSS

Also, I like to make people's lives more straightforward and be a part of that, but most of all, I love solving challenges. Every day is a new challenge, a new mindset, a new emotion, a new talk. Everything becomes different. That’s the magic.

I’m based in São Paulo, Brazil, and I’ve been working remotely for the last ~3 years in a US healthcare company. This experience has been unique because I improved my software skills, english-speaking language comprehensibility, soft skills, and interpersonal side by talking and sharing my points of view with many people.

I am addicted to software engineering, and I love continuously improving my skills. The beauty of this role is that there is always more to learn, just “like the infinite possibilities of the universe.”.
